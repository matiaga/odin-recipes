    <p>Cauliflower Pizza Crust comes out crispy, you can hold the slice
         and use frozen cauliflower or cauliflower rice to make it. 
         Tasty, low carb and the best recipe on the web.</p>
    <p>Thanks to this wonderful base, we can eat pizza without remorse, a
        very healthy dinner and if you are pregnant we already told you that cauliflower is
        a highly recommended food in your diet due to its high content of
        folates.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small cauliflower</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>150 gr grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fried tomato</li>
        <li>assorted tomatoes</li>
        <li>grated cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Oregano and Basil </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> First, chop your head of cauliflower into florets and put it 
            into your food processor.</li>
        <li>Pulse the florets until they resemble rice or couscous. 
            You may need to pulse it in batches. 
            Add the cauliflower “rice” to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Next, microwave the pulsed cauliflower for 5 minutes OR steam 
            it in a pot with one inch of water for about 5 minutes. 
            You do you.</li>
        <li>Wait till it cools so you don’t burn your hand like I did. 
            Very important step here people.</li>
        <li>Once the cauliflower is cool enough to handle, take a clean 
            dish towel or cheesecloth and put the steamed cauliflower 
            ‘rice’ into the middle and wrap the dish towel around it. 
            Squeeze all the water out. 
            It will look weird like the photo above.</li>
        <li>Good job. Now place the cauliflower in a large bowl and add 
            cheeses, coconut flour, egg, spices and salt. Mix it well. 
            It’s going to be soft and slightly wet — don’t worry!</li>
        <li>Dump that ball onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 
            Spread it out with your hands (just press out) and leave a 1/4 
            inch thickness as pictured above. It should be about 9-10 
            inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Prebake the crust without any topping on it so that it sets 
            and turns a nice golden brown color.</li>
        <li>NOW TOP IT with anything your heart desires. AND BAKE AGAIN
             until that cheese melts and becomes perfectly bubbly</li>

    </ol>
